### What is IELTS?

The **IELTS** (International English Language Testing System) is a globally recognized language proficiency test for non-native English speakers. It assesses listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills. IELTS is commonly required for university admissions, immigration, and professional certifications in English-speaking countries. It has two formats: **Academic** (for higher education) and **General Training** (for work or migration). 

The IELTS is scored on a 9-band scale, with each band corresponding to a level of English competence, ranging from non-user (Band 1) to expert (Band 9).
